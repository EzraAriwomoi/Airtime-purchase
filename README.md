## Airtime Purchase using IntaSend API

This project demonstrates how to purchase airtime using the IntaSend API.

### Requirements
- **IntaSend Account:** To make the code work, you need an active IntaSend account.
- **API Credentials:** Obtain your API credentials from the IntaSend dashboard after creating an account.

### Setup
1. **Get your credentials:**
   - Go to the IntaSend dashboard and retrieve your `consumerKey` and `consumerSecret`.
     
   
2. **Add your credentials to the code:**
   Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials in the following variables:
   ```php
   $consumerKey = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";     
   $consumerSecret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";
   ```
   
   These credentials are required for the IntaSend API to function correctly.

### Steps to Create an IntaSend Account
If you donâ€™t have an account, follow these steps to create one:
1. Visit the [IntaSend Website](https://intasend.com/).
2. Click on **Sign Up**.
3. Fill out the required details and verify your email.
4. Once registered, navigate to the **API Keys** section to get your credentials.

### Usage
